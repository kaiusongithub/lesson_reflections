When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- When working together with other people, I don´t want to have all their changes on my local repository
- I also maybe want to have two versions of my project -> local and public version

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- fork is an online (on github) clone of a remote from another person. I would use it, when I want to work on onther persons project with having it available on github.
- clone is a duplication on an online available remote to my local computer. I would use it when I want to make changes on a remote on my local computer.
- a branch is a duplication of a specified commit, where I can make changes in without affecting my current commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- As you don´t know who is gonna do changes on your version on github it´s good to have a kind of a backup version
- When you want to continue working on your project and don´t have online access it´s helpful to have an offline state available

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I would share the files in a cloud server
- It would make it easier to commit changes as they are automatically in the latest file
- You wouldn´t be able to accept or decline changes as you´re not asked to pull changes

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- When I´m not quite sure whether my changes will work or whether I want them to be in my master (or in a separate version)
- Making them in a separate branch makes it easier, to maintain my master without being affected by the changes in the branch
- But it makes it harder so merge the changes once I want them to be a part of my master
- Making changes directly in my master makes sure, that my master always contains the new stuff
